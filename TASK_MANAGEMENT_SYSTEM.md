  title: "Implement user authentication",
  description: "Add login/logout functionality with JWT tokens",
  projectId: "project_id_here",
  assignedTo: ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"],
  priority: "high",

  estimatedHours: 16,
  tags: ["authentication", "security"],
  category: "development",
};

const response = await fetch("/api/tasks", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(taskData),
});
```

### Adding a Comment

```javascript
const commentData = {
  content: "I've completed the initial implementation. Please review.",
  userId: "current_user_id",
  mentions: ["reviewer_user_id"],
};

const response = await fetch(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/comments`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(commentData),
});
```

### Logging Time

```javascript
const timeEntry = {
  userId: "current_user_id",
  description: "Implemented JWT token validation",
  startTime: "2025-01-25T09:00:00.000Z",
  endTime: "2025-01-25T12:30:00.000Z",
  duration: 3.5,
};

const response = await fetch(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/time-tracking`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(timeEntry),
});
```

## Integration with Existing System

The task management system integrates seamlessly with the existing project management system:

1. **Project Integration**: Tasks are linked to projects and can be filtered by project
2. **Milestone Connection**: Tasks can be associated with project milestones
3. **Employee System**: Uses existing employee database for assignments and user management
4. **Audit Logging**: All task activities are logged using the existing audit system
5. **Notification Framework**: Leverages existing notification infrastructure

## Security Features

- **User Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid user authentication
- **Permission Checks**: Users can only access tasks they're assigned to or have permission to view
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log of all task activities and changes
- **File Upload Security**: Secure file handling with type validation and size limits
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and data

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized indexes for fast task querying and filtering
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large task lists
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Optimized MongoDB aggregation for reporting
- **Caching**: Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
- **File Storage**: Efficient file storage and retrieval system

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile application for task management
- **Advanced Reporting**: More sophisticated analytics and custom report builder
- **Integration APIs**: Third-party integrations with tools like Slack, JIRA, etc.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Machine learning for task estimation and productivity insights
- **Gantt Charts**: Visual project timeline and dependency management
- **Resource Planning**: Advanced resource allocation and capacity planning

## Getting Started

1. **Access Task Management**: Navigate to `/task-management` in the application
2. **Create Your First Task**: Click "Create Task" and fill in the required information
3. **Assign Team Members**: Use the assignment dialog to assign tasks to team members
4. **Track Progress**: Update task status and log time as work progresses
5. **Monitor Analytics**: Visit `/task-reports` to view team performance and project insights

The task management system is now fully integrated and ready to enhance your team's productivity and project delivery capabilities.
